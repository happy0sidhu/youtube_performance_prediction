Storyline for Your Interview
Title: "From Raw Data to Actionable Insights: Building a YouTube View Prediction Model"

Narrative:
*"I built a model to predict YouTube video views—a challenging task due to extreme variance in view counts. Starting with raw video metadata and thumbnail features, I engineered log-transformed targets to handle skewness and implemented a hybrid Random Forest + Quantile Regression approach. While traditional metrics showed limitations (269% MAE in raw views), I focused on delivering business value through prediction intervals. The final model provides creators with a likely view range (e.g., '5K–19K views') and achieves 72.5% coverage of actual views within its bounds. Key innovations included robust feature engineering (like upload-time harmonics) and addressing overfitting via quantile loss. Next steps include adding engagement signals (likes/comments) to tighten intervals."*

Step-by-Step Interview Preparation List
1. Problem Framing
Identified business need: Predict YouTube views to help creators optimize content.

Defined success: Actionable ranges (not just point estimates).

2. Data Collection
Merged two datasets:

thumbnail_features.csv (visual attributes)

youtube_dataset_with_full_countries.csv (metadata, views).

Handled missing data:

Filled genre/category with "unknown."

Imputed text features (e.g., empty titles).

3. Feature Engineering
Transformed targets:

Log10(view_count + 1) to handle skew.

Capped extreme views at 99th percentile.

Created time-based features:

upload_hour, upload_dayofweek, upload_month.

Engineered text features:

title_length, TF-IDF on titles.

4. Preprocessing Pipeline
Built a ColumnTransformer with:

Numeric: Median imputation + RobustScaler.

Categorical: Mode imputation + TargetEncoder.

Text: TfidfVectorizer (100 max features).

5. Baseline Model (Random Forest)
Trained with RandomizedSearchCV (20 iterations, 5-fold CV).

Best params: max_depth=30, n_estimators=463, etc.

Results:

Train R²: 0.90 → Overfitting detected.

Test R²: 0.62 → Explained 62% of variance.

6. Quantile Regression (LightGBM)
Targeted quantiles: [0.1, 0.5, 0.9] for prediction intervals.

Achieved:

72.5% coverage (actual views within 1.9x range).

Pinball loss: 0.0196 for 90th percentile.

7. Hybrid Approach
Combined Random Forest (median) + Quantile (ranges).

Visualized intervals showing underprediction for viral videos.

8. Business Metrics
Translated to creator-friendly outputs:

"Your video will likely get between 5.3K–19K views (72.5% confidence)."

9. Limitations & Next Steps
Shortcomings:

72.5% coverage < target 80%.

1.9x range may be too broad for monetization.

Improvements:

Add features: Title sentiment, days since last upload.

Test XGBoost’s reg:quantileerror.

How to Present in Interviews
Structure: Follow the storyline above (problem → solution → impact).

Metrics: Emphasize coverage (72.5%) over MAE.

Visuals: Show the prediction intervals plot (explain the gray band).

Lessons Learned:

"Log-transforms improve modeling but inflate real-world error metrics."

"Prediction intervals are more useful than point estimates for volatile targets."

Pro Tip: Prepare a 1-slide summary with:

Before/after metrics (MAE → coverage).

i i input a query wht metrics will i get when i tru to predict my data'
When you input a query to predict YouTube video views using your model, here are the key metrics and outputs you'll receive, structured for clarity:

1. Point Estimate (Median Prediction)
What: The "most likely" view count (50th percentile).

Metric:

python
median_views = 10**model.predict(input_data)[0]  # Convert from log scale
Example Output:
"Predicted median views: 100,000"

2. Prediction Interval (80% Range)
What: The range within which actual views will fall 72.5% of the time (adjustable to 80% with tweaks).

Metrics:

python
lower_bound = 10**models[0.1].predict(input_data)[0]  # 10th percentile
upper_bound = 10**models[0.9].predict(input_data)[0]  # 90th percentile
Example Output:
"Likely range: 53,000 to 190,000 views (72.5% confidence)"

3. Uncertainty Quantification
Coverage: Percentage of actual views falling within the predicted range (currently 72.5%).

Interval Width:

python
width_multiplier = 10**(models[0.9].predict(input_data) - models[0.1].predict(input_data))
Example Output:
"Uncertainty: Views may vary by up to 1.9x from the median."

4. Business-Ready Output (Recommended)
Combine all metrics into a single interpretable response:

python
{
  "predicted_median_views": 100000,
  "prediction_interval": [53000, 190000],
  "confidence": "72.5% coverage",
  "uncertainty": "1.9x range (upper/lower bounds)",
  "risk_assessment": "10% chance views < 53K; 10% chance > 190K"
}
Key Notes for Interviews
Focus on Intervals:

"For volatile metrics like views, ranges are more useful than exact numbers."

Address the 72.5% Coverage:

"We’re improving coverage by adding features like title sentiment and creator activity patterns."

Log-Scale Translation:

Always convert back to raw views (10**prediction) for stakeholders.

Visual Aid:

Show the prediction intervals plot to explain the gray band (80% interval).

When to Use Which Metric
Scenario	Recommended Output
Content Planning	Median + Range (e.g., 100K ±1.9x)
Risk Analysis	10th/90th Percentiles
Sponsor Negotiations	Conservative Estimate (10th %ile)
